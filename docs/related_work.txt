picalo
------

- http://www.picalo.org/ 
- http://pypi.python.org/pypi/picalo/ 
- http://www.picalo.org/download/api/

A GUI application and Python library primarily aimed at data analysis
for auditors & fraud examiners, but has a number of general purpose
data mining and transformation capabilities like filter, join,
transpose, crosstable/pivot.

Does not rely on streaming/iterative processing of data, and has a
persistence capability based on zodb for handling larger datasets.

csvkit
------

- http://pypi.python.org/pypi/picalo/
- http://csvkit.rtfd.org/

A set of command-line utilities for transforming tabular data from CSV
(delimited) files. Includes csvclean, csvcut, csvjoin, csvsort,
csvstack, csvstat, csvgrep, csvlook.

Google Refine
-------------

- http://code.google.com/p/google-refine/

A web application for exploring, filtering, cleaning and transforming
a table of data. Some excellent functionality for finding and fixing
problems in data. Does have the capability to join two tables, but
generally it's one table at a time. Some question marks over ability
to handle larger datasets. 

Has an extension capability, two third party extensions known at the
time of writing, including a `stats extension

Data Wrangler

- http://pypi.python.org/pypi/DataWrangler

A web application for exploring, transforming and cleaning tabular
data, in a similar vein to Google Refine but with a strong focus on
usability, and more capabilities for transforming tables, including
folding/unfolding (similar to R reshape's melt/cast) and
cross-tabulation.

Currently a client-side only web application, not available for
download. There is also a Python library providing data transformation
functions as found in the GUI. The research paper has a good
discussion of data transformation and quality issues, esp. w.r.t. tool
usability.
