- [done] implement fromtext(filename, header=['lines'])
- [done] document fromtext
- [won't do] implement stringreplace as a conversion function

- [done] review split behaviour when there are more splits than fields
- [done] review capture behaviour when there are more splits than fields
- [done] implement extendfields
- [done] implement unpack, or some other way to go from a single field containing list or tuple values to multiple fields
- [done] review aggregate behaviour with no reducer function - produce list? (like recast)
- [done] review mergereduce behaviour - set or list?
- [done] implement join (inner equijoin) with key argument
- [done] implement join (inner equijoin) without key argument (natural join) 
- [done] implement left outer join
- [done] implement right outer join
- [done] implement full outer join
- [done] document leftjoin, rightjoin, outerjoin
- [done] refactor join functions
- [done] implement crossjoin
- [done] implement antijoin
- [done] implement rangeaggregate/binaggregate/segagg/partitionaggregate ... aggregate by numerical field that has been partitioned
- (0.3) partitioning of alpha fields?
- [done] values on a combination of fields
- [done] modify sort to use merge sort above a given buffer size
- [done] change 'fields' to 'header'
- [done] support for reverse=True when above buffer size
- [done] profile forward and reverse sorting with big files
- [done] add buffersize arg to all transformations that depend on sorting
- [done] provide ability to set default buffersize globally
- [done] modify sort to keep cached data and check cachetag values
- [done] implement setfields
- [done] implement rangecounts
- [done] implement string lengths as utility function
- [won't do] get rid of 'values', add *args to data instead?
- [done] simplify args to values
- [done] rangecounts and rangeaggregate should have min and max params instead of start
- [done] document rangecounts

- implement rangefacet - facet by numerical field into any number of bins by a given interval size
- implement rangerowreduce, rangerecordreduce

- make convert args more flexible
- autoconvert multiple fields to numeric types - convenience function
- translate/replace single value in a field, e.g., None to zero; maybe also apply to multiple fields
- convert with dictionary (which translate is a convenience for)

- implement cachetag for all view classes

- make sure we don't get tripped up by attempts to compare tuples with lists
- implement selectlen - select by row length
- implement stringjoin as aggregation function (or can you just pass ', '.join?)
- implement missingness
- implement transpose
- check how cat and cut handle long/short rows; are they using itemgetter where possible?

- implement pivot?
- implement crosstab?

- implement fromxml
- lookall
- selectgt, selectlt, selectge, selectle
- records s/padding/missing/ ?

- implement validator module based on csvvalidator
- implement filldown
- implement fillup
- implement fillright? 
- implement fillleft?
- implement rowgroupby? generate sequence of key/row iterator pairs?
- implement recordgroupby?
- show rows/values causing conversion or translation errors
